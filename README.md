# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning in Maze Navigation

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate a custom built maze environment.  
The goal is to demonstrate how an agent can learn optimal behavior through trial and error, using feedback in the form of rewards and penalties.

## 📌 Project Overview

We developed a 2D maze simulation in Python and applied the **Q-Learning** algorithm to train an agent to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal. The maze environment includes obstacles and supports visualization of the agent's movements and learning process.

### 🔍 Key Components:
- A fully custom maze environment built with pygame library
- Q learning algorithm implementation
